periods pain
Menstrual pain, or dysmenorrhea, is a common experience during periods. The pain typically occurs in the lower abdomen but can also radiate to the lower back and thighs.

Some ways to manage period pain include:

Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen
Applying heat with a heating pad or warm bath
Gentle exercise like walking or stretching
Adequate rest and stress management
Staying hydrated and maintaining a balanced diet
If period pain is severe, disrupts daily activities, or has suddenly worsened, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider as it could indicate an underlying condition that requires treatment.
