Common causes of fever include:

Viral infections like the common cold or flu
Bacterial infections such as strep throat or urinary tract infections
Inflammatory conditions
Medication reactions
Immunizations
To manage a fever:

Stay hydrated with water, clear broths, or sports drinks
Rest and avoid physical exertion
Take over-the-counter fever reducers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen as directed
Dress in lightweight clothing and use light blankets
Take a lukewarm bath or apply cool compresses
Seek medical attention if the fever is extremely high (above 103째F or 39.4째C), lasts more than three days, or is accompanied by severe headache, unusual skin rash, persistent vomiting, difficulty breathing, or seizures.
